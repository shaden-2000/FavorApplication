## Idea 
Basically the app provides services of different categories " from which the name of the site is derived The app serves all Categories,  educational services such as learning programming, or entertainment services such as you can hire a tour guide or services that help you start your project, or you can develop your talent by searching for educational lessons that interest you and develop your skills Freelancers are the main segment of the app's users who provide their services to clients from all over the world.
